            <h2>Kingdom of Froggies</h2>
            <h2>Background Info & Lore: </h2>
            <p>The Kingdom of Froggies is one of, if not the, most lore intensive nation within the entirety of Jeracraft. With various stories & RP factions, it would make sense that to have such an abundance of such rich lore would be due to a very established organization system.
            </p>
            <h2>The general story behind Froggieville goes like this</h2>
            <p>In a far-off and peculiar land, an explorer named Jeracraft discovered a place of wonders and sent out a call for people to come and dwell there. However, a terrible curse afflicted Jeracraft and the magical ways to the new land were closed for a time. In the meantime, a group of people built a town and dedicated it to the Frog god, Frod. As more people arrived, the town grew, attracting those seeking wealth, exploration, or spiritual journeys.
            </p>
            <p>Though the Church of Frod was the town's official religion, other groups vied for influence, including the mischievous Axolotl Cult and the greedy Fox Mafia. The Guard did their best to maintain order, but could only do so much without the groups revealing themselves.

                Recently, Jeracraft's new land opened after a year of waiting, but much of the once-bustling town was tragically destroyed during the magical transportation. Now, the town is being rebuilt and experiencing a temporary peace. However, strange events may still come to Froggieville.
                </p>
                <p>[This part I just assumed]Below each nation’s head figures, lie the Chairmen. The general officers of the Kingdom of Froggies and trusted officials who answer right below the head figures of the nation. Each head leader within the Kingdom of Froggies has a right to be entitled to a certain # of chairmen who answer directly to their corresponding leader and are in charge of directing the orders & projects each head commands.

                    And beneath all of the above lie the regular citizens of Froggieville who are assigned roles based on their contributions towards the nation, which living district they reside in, and also their RP alignment. Roles that we know of within the Kingdom of Froggies include…
                    </p>
                <p>Now with this background knowledge, there are 5 main RP factions that exist within the Kingdom of Froggies:
                </p>
                <h2>The Great Frog Church</h2>
                <p>The official religion in Froggieville is the Church, where believers strive to reach higher stages of enlightenment and communion with the Great Frog. All citizens are part of the Church, and those who violate its rules are punished by the Guard. There will be an upcoming election for the position of Head of
                    the Church, who will oversee other church-related positions and ceremonies, and may assist with town-wide events.
                </p>
                <h2>The Fox Mafia</h2>
                <p>The Mafia is a profit-driven group that owns the casino and operates outside of the law. While they clash with the Guard, the Mafia also faces consequences for breaking the law. Their daily duties include managing and promoting the casino, and safeguarding their profits from potential interference by the Axolotl Cult.</p>
                <h2>The Cult of the Smiling Axolotl</h2>
                <p>The Cult is a mysterious group that worships the Smiling Axolotl, the god of trickery, and carries out their activities in secrecy. Their leader and meeting place are unknown. They play harmless pranks and have a friendly relationship with the Church, while detesting the Mafia and working to undermine their profit-making efforts. Their daily duties include recruiting new members, sabotaging the Mafia's schemes, maintaining their secret temple, and performing secret rites and ceremonies. However, members who are caught engaging in pranks will be sent to prison.
                </p>
                <h2>The Guard</h2>
                <p>The Guard is responsible for maintaining law and order in Froggieville and their members are selected through a special process. Their duties include patrolling the town, standing guard at designated locations, enforcing the in-character Town Laws, and cleaning up any messes caused by pranks or graffiti. Being selected to join the Guard is considered a great honor. 
                </p>
                <h2>The Church of Driedius Kelpius</h2>
                <p>The Guard is responsible for maintaining law and order in Froggieville and their members are selected through a special process. Their duties include patrolling the town, standing guard at designated locations, enforcing the in-character Town Laws, and cleaning up any messes caused by pranks or graffiti. Being selected to join the Guard is considered a great honor.</p>
