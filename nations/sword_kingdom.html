            <h2>The Sword Kingdom</h2>
            <p>Summary: The Sword Kingdom, an oriental-based nation settled upon the western coast of Tsushima, is an ancient kingdom with a history rich as their builds are beautiful. Offering its citizens not only the biggest Japanese-themed build in the server, but also a friendly and lore-intensive environment, it is no surprise that the Sword Kingdom is an elder staple towards the world of Jeracraft.
            </p>
            <h2>Origin Story:</h2>
            <p> Origin Story: Long ago during the pre-updaterian era of Jeracraft, there was a samurai by the name of M0S_Doge, who was known with his title as Sword King throughout the lands. This was not only because of his fabled skill but also due to his collection of legendary swords he collected throughout his time of adventuring. It was said that his collection had almost every unique sword within the treasures of Jeracraft.</p>
            <p>However, even with all his wealth & power, Doge still longed for more. He wanted to create his own nation. To create his own small community where players could live and build within a prospering oriental town. Thus, he partnered with an old war-friend by the name of ArcaneMuse, and the two collaborated to build the Kingdom’s two most significant builds: The Sword King’s Palace, a place for where the current Sword King shall reside. And the dojo, a building containing the collection of swords M0S_Doge obtained throughout his lifetime. With these two builds, word of this place slowly expanded. And as their reputation grew, so did their population, and as their population grew so did their builds. Expanding the nation into what we now know today as… The Sword Kingdom.</p>
