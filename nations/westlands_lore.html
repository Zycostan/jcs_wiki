            <h2>Empire of Westlands</h2>
            <h2>Lore: </h2>
            <h2>Chapter 1. The Beginnings of the Fall
            </h2>
            <p>The WestLands was a small but flourishing nation that has lived in peace and prosperity for generations, tucked away in a far corner of the world. Their leaders and the Wise Senate, have created a flourishing and peaceful place where children played in the streets and others built monumental structures that were to represent the era of peace.
                But over the mountains a danger had risen. An evil nation, a long forgotten enemy, which has long-prepared to destroy the WestLands, launched a sudden invasion on its lands, their peaceful life was quickly broken. The Wise Senate rallied their citizens to join forces and fight back against their attackers and so the West Legions marched.
                The battles were fierce and there were many losses on both sides. Towns and villages fell but with the power that the evil nation has gained, the people of WestLands had to eventually fall back and figure out a way to escape certain death. As they watched the enemy slowly close in to their capital walls they realized that this might be the last time they will ever see freedom and peace. 
                The emperor gathered his wisest senators and asked them if there was any hope to save his people from destruction. One of the advisors came out and suggested that in the far away mountains, there was a powerful dragon who had been sleeping for centuries and who is under the same threat as killing the last dragon would mean that there would not be anything to stop the enemy march. He claimed that if they could find the dragon, wake it up and inform it of this great threat, it would be their salvation. 
                </p>
            <h2>Chapter  2. The Choice
            </h2>
            <p>The emperor had no choice but to go on this quest and find the dragon in order to save his people. After weeks of journey and many hardships, he finally found the dragon's cave and woke it up. It had nearly been the emperor's doom but in the end the dragon agreed to help him in exchange for a favor: they would have to protect its egg from the enemy forces until their last breath. 
                The Emperor agreed and flew back with the dragon and its egg in its hands. Once again the senators and all the generals of the West Legions came together and discussed all of the possible ways to win this war. The enemy was too strong and everyone knew that very well.                                         
                It had been decided, they would fortify the capital and make it their last stand against evil.
                
                
                In desperation the emperor issued a complete mobilization of the nation's forces and gathered the whole population to fortify their city. Even Though the nation was well-known for their expert fighting skills and had been through war with their enemies many times in their past. Now, they faced an even bigger threat and needed to find a way to protect and preserve their legacy. 
                
                Led by their wise emperor and Dragon Of The West, the people went on  and built strong defenses against the impending attack. With great resilience and determination, they managed to build all kinds of defenses around the city, including walls that were as tall as mountains. The people also trained hard for battle so that when their enemies eventually came, they would be ready for them.
                </p>
            <h2>Chapter 3. The battle
            </h2>
            <p>It seemed that the enemy was gaining strength and power while WestLands was on the brink of defeat. But in the darkest hour the Emperor, the Dragon and the army of the finest WestLands warriors were now ready to take on the seemingly unbeatable forces of Evil. 

                On the eve of the battle as death was closing in, it happened. Enormous army of hundreds of thousands of men was facing the walls of the last defense of the WestLands. As the massive enemy army was marching towards their gates, the emperor sought the help of the ancient dragon, the last of its kind, to aid in their defense against the impending doom. 
                
                The dragon led the charge against the enemy and at first managed to keep them at bay with its might and ferocity. But the enemy was too strong and managed to break through the main walls and get into the city. That was when all of the WestLands legions marched against the enemy, archers pulled their bows and covered the battlefield with thousands of arrows but it wasn't enough, the enemy just kept on coming. 
                
                The emperor called off all the forces to the main castle as the last line of defense but something unexpected happened. The Dragon seeing as they were loosing, seeing all the misery and torture and seeing how its egg was in danger, it uses its last bit of strength and turned itself into a massive fire storm, flew straight into the enemy killing their leader and everything around. 
                
                The city laid in ruins, fires everywhere, statues fallen over and ships sinking at the sea. The dragon sacrificed itself to save the emperor, his people and its egg from certain death. Everyone looked on helplessly as the dragon took its last breath in front of them and just before it perished, it said its last message that quote “This child shall be your nation’s protector when it rises again from this egg”.
                
                </p>
            <h2>Chapter 4. The New Era 
            </h2>
            <p>The cost of victory was high, their beloved city was left in ruins, families were broken and much was lost. But the people were determined to rebuild and quickly set about restoring order to WestLands and organizing the rebuilding efforts. 
                The Emperor established trade routes with other countries and cities, as well as assistance from friendly nations in rebuilding their economy. He also focused on developing new technologies and creating more space for efficiency and with his senators chose the plan on how they will restore their city.
                It was decided that the new city will be built above the ruins of the old city so as to remember their past and never forget how with great resilience they manage to survive. 
                Renewed hope spread throughout WestLands as its citizens worked diligently to rebuild their city brick by brick and piece by piece. As time passed, it became evident that WestLands had become stronger and more resilient than ever before.
