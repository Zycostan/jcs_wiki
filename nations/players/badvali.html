            <h2>Vali Kashikoi (BadVali_)</h2>
            <h2>Lore:</h2>
            <p>Carrying blood of the northern folk of Tsushima, a young Vali Kashikoi who’s name everyone would acknowledge in the future was of humble beginnings. When he was young, he had to live off of scraps and had to resort to thievery in order to survive and feed his friends, since he had no family. Two weeks after he reached the age of 11, his group was caught stealing from a noble forcing them to run for their lives. They made their way to the docks of their local town and hid in a ship called “The Blood Rose”  with an abundance of cannons that one would not find in a merchant's ship. Little did he know, this incident would change his fate forever.</p>
            <p>The boat, to Vali’s dread, was setting sail, and he could not come out since he was guilty and hiding from the local authority. He laid down anxiously in the galley, looking out through the portholes onto the pale moon and the glistening ocean. 

                Eventually, due to some incident or the other, they were found by the “sailors” present on this ship. They were brought to the Captain, a greedy man whose name was overshadowed and forgotten in the history books. The Captain offered to take them in as pirates, provided they were loyal to him. Vali, seeing no other option, reluctantly obeyed. </p>
            <p>His teenage years were spent pillaging alongside the pirates of The Blood Rose, during this time he learnt shipcraft and naval warfare. His favorite pastime was reading books from the various different places he traveled, obtaining quite a collection of various works. He gained quite the reputation among the crew as an intelligent tactician and competent leader. Due to his reputation, Vali was offered by the Captain to be his first mate, on the condition that he lead a raid on a city on the northern reaches of Tsushima…. It was the city that he came from. Despite his poor upbringing, he had fond memories of his childhood, stealing from the nobles and merchants, sleeping beneath the grand array of silver dots in the night sky... He was conflicted</p>
            <p>After some discussion with his group, he decided that if he were to correct this twisted ideology present on this ship, he must remove all emotion from his heart and attack the city regardless. And so he went, and on the coast of Tsushima, he encountered M0S_Doge, a renowned swordsman, known by the title of “Sword King”.

                During this battle, Vali tried his best not to hurt any civilians that came across his way. The Sword King noticed his chivalry, and offered him a fair duel. Vali, being the clever young man he was, accepted. They fought long and hard, Doge being many times more skilled in the sword than Vali, but Vali used the terrain of the boat to his advantage. *Whoooosh*, in the climatic moment, Doge disarmed Vali, and told him the following words, “You have a good heart, if you continue down this path, you will hate thyself. I will cleanse the corrupt among your crew, but you and your friends are safe. Go, take thy ship and leave. Meet me at the southern coast of Tsushima, and I will guide you to your destiny.” And so he left.
                
                
                Vali eventually came to the southern coast of the Tsushima, and was left speechless by the sight of the most beautiful kingdom he had ever seen. He joined the new nation in hopes of building instead of destroying, and so he did. He gained influence rapidly and eventually became the Commander of the Naval Fleet, and led his own “Water Faction”, focused on the seas and the coast. He also focused on gathering books and opened a humble bookshop, trading knowledge and various scrolls with other scholars to promote the education of the masses, and to satisfy his personal interest in seeking wisdom. He renamed “The Blood Rose '' into the “The Crimson Ryu”, as Ryu’s are creatures born to defend and protect, instead of kill and cause havoc. The Crimson Ryu would serve as the flagship of the Sword Fleet for years to come. Eventually, he was crowned, obtaining the title of “Ice Emperor”, and the “Frost Dragon '' (due to the name of the ship and his place of birth). And as they say, the rest is history.
