            </p>
            <h2>Origin Story:</h2>
            <p> When the kingdom of Astraria was still a small Republic, Emperor Popcorn4555 and his mistress Empress Sapphos were still in the makings of putting their nation on the world stage, being recognized by much bigger nations at the time</p>
            <p>The nation known as the Kingdom of DawnHaven were interested in making official trade relations with the small Republic. Emperor Popcorn set out alone to try and look humble before a much stronger foe, or maybe a new friend…

                On the way, the Emperor stopped at a local restaurant. Inside he met a man named Grote, and the two bonded over a drink of Scottish beer. When the sun settled and night fast approaching, the Emperor hastily gathered his things and left the small restaurant. The Emperor walked through the midnight forest, alone and in the dark…
                
                Suddenly, out of nowhere a small group of bandits ambushed the Emperor! He fended them off for as long as he could, until an arrow flew past by and struck his shoulder. He then ran 
                into the deep depths of the forest with the bandits fast on his tail; however, the more he ran the more his vision blurred and stomach uneasy. The arrow was poisoned    
            </p>
            <p>Amidst the mark of death, one thought focused on his mind: “I must get back to my wife.” He persevered through the pain and suffering, but alas he fell down in a pool of his blood. With most of his strength gone, the poison had started to work its magic. He crawled and scraped his way through the bushes, but the bandits were now upon him. Lying helplessly on the floor, the Emperor had accepted his fate…

                However, as the Emperor thought his time was up he noticed how quiet it was. No footsteps and no one looting his soon-to-be corpse. He slowly turned around and saw that each and every bandit was dead, all pierced by an arrow. The Emperor turned to see a shadow in front of him…
                </p>
                <p>“Come on friend, let's get you back to where you came from.” The voice sounded so familiar, yet the Emperor couldn’t make out who he was. He didn’t have time to think as he was picked up and put in the back of a cart.

                    It was then bright and early in the morning, once the Emperor had woken up. He was stiff and sore. Tired and groaning. He was still in the cart from the night of the ambush. Suddenly he hears a faint voice, “Ah… you're awake, finally.” 
                    
                    The Emperor replies, “I would say thanks but I must ask, who are you?” His question is then met by a homely laugh. “Ho Ho Ho,” the stranger said, “I thought you would recognize me from my voice, we didn’t meet that long ago either.” The Emperor looked up as he finally recognized the mysterious savior. It was Grote, the man from the bar!
                    
                    Thankful for his reunion, the Emperor says, “Ah Grote, my good friend, I thank you, I am in your debt.”  “Don’t thank me yet,” Grote responds, “We haven’t gotten back to your kingdom, speaking of which, I think I see it in the distance, we are in the home stretch,”
                    
                    The village of Astrary had never looked so beautiful. When the Emperor arrived in the village and the villagers started to take notice of who was wheeled in the cart, he was
