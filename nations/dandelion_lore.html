            <h2>Dandelist Hands</h2>
            <h2>History: </h2>
            <h2>The Complete History: 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pre-Dandelist Stages:
                The Pre-Dandelist stages of the young nation is a very vague area, it was known as "Northlands", ruled by Emperor_Toast
                Soon after the formation of this nation, it united with Eldoria, forming the Kingdom of the North, in which a man named "Heracles" proclaimed himself the king of the North (Emperor_Toast was the one who had the idea of the union)
                Out of spite for this, Emperor_Toast went down south to a warmer area, an area filled with dandelions, an Area that was a blessing and a curse

                Dandelist Stages:
                The Dandelist Stages or what was called by Emperor_Toast himself called "The Dandelist Golden Age" was a period in the Server's history filled with War are Chaos
                A few days after Emperor_Toast had made the nation of "Dandelona", he declared independence from the Kingdom of the North, spiring a rebellion within the area
                a City separated into East and West, East controlled by the North, and West controlled by Westlands, and after Emperor_Toast had announced independence, the first battle began
                Consisting a coalition of Emperor_Toast and Sinister_A against Aspect252, TheAprilist (Semi-full Netherite), and IksBat13

                The battle was won by the Dandelist and now semi-independent, had a golden age, literature, art, and reforms in the government occured
                and the cathedral had been completed, becoming the center of the Dandelist world, all good right?

                Dandelist Coup:
                [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] , and almost being overthrown, [Redacted] [Redacted]
                [Redacted] [Redacted] being supported by the Westlands government, [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted] [Redacted]
                The coup was unsuccessful, and the Toast's government had survived, it was at this point a man named "SirElyan" took care of the city of Dandelona whilst Toast was offline

                The Expansion and Steady-Downfall:
                with the ever growing preassure from some people of the nation for Toast to leave government, he made a new town UNDER the Dandelist Hands, a place soon to be called "CrownsOfHaven"
                The CrownsOfHaven started off good, with Cheeky joining the town and both Dandelona + CrownsOfHaven expanding, after awhile Haulidaie joined, which kick started the economy of the nation
                more stuff happened, and the Dandelist Hands began losing members, mainly pvp members as barely any wars happened
                Then after the Dandelist Hands united with Toki and DarkSiders, whilst still losing members and growing in economy
                
                After awhile Emperor_Toast left, and Haulidaie + Langos took control

                and so far thats where the story goes, i forgot to document the rest
