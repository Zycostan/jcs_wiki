            <h2>Stikt VII Duke of Glücksburg (Stikt)</h2>
            <h2>Lore:</h2>
            <p>Stikt (Born 28 January 2023) Duke of Glücksburg, is an aristocrat and businessman from the duchy of Glücksburg in the southwest of Saxum</p>
            <p>Stikt was born into the imperial family of the Benelux nation during the rule of his paternal grandfather TrollBoss II as the 2nd child of the then Heir apparent Lord Hexion (later Hexion I). At the age of 3 the great Sunwar inflicted and Stikt was forced to flee to the summer residence of the imperial family, the Glücksburg Monolith. When the war ended at the age of 18 he chose to reside the rest of his days at Glücksburg and took on the name Stikt VII. 
            </p>
            <p>He transformed most of the monolith into a luxurious palace on the 2nd floor. And set up the very first Data Collection institute of the server (WDCI) which became the prime issuer of ID cards and other official documents. 
            </p>
            <p>Stikt is also often credited with the creation of the first server religion, Bopism, and is the first author of the Bop bible.
                As businessman Stikt is seen as one of the richest players on the server with an estimated net worth of $3 million. This is largely due to the fact he is one of the only known owners of an ancient artifact, and not only 1 but 9. The way he came to possess this many artifacts has been kept a secret by him to this day. 
                </p>
